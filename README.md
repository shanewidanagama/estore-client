# How it's Made

**Tech Used:** React, Material UI, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Vite, React Router

- Tested this web app with mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screens while developing using Chrome DevTools
- MUI's Material UI was used for styling because of its wealth of reusable components to reduce needed to produce an MVP
- This application does not need to appear high in search results, so time to first paint is less of a concern 
- Vite was chosen to decrease server start times.

# Optimizations
If I had more time I would,
- Move global styles in the index.css to the CSSBaseline element in App.tsx to avoid naming conflicts
- Use this [guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#tailwind-css) to better integrate TailwindCSS and MUI to avoid style overrides that are hard to troubleshoot

# Lessons Learned

- Inspecting similar web apps to the one you want to build in Chrome DevTools is a great way to learn how to build them.
